color:black'>Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, but Peter wrote only two, containing
a total of eight chapters. Nevertheless, even though Peter’s writings are
brief, he uses certain terms that cannot be found in the writings of Paul. For
example, Peter speaks of the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:19). Although
Paul speaks concerning the blood of Christ, he does not use this particular
expression, the precious blood.</span></p>

lang=EN-AU style='font-size:30.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:black'>At this point we need to see that a particular characteristic of
Peter’s writing is his use of adjectives, especially high adjectives. Along
with the precious blood, Peter mentions the incorruptible seed, unfading glory,
and divine power. Paul does not use these expressions. Peter, however, had the
habit of using such adjectives. But this was more than a habit; it is an
indication that something had truly been built into Peter’s character.</span></p>

color:black'>Through the Spirit of reality something solid, high, rich, and
strong was built into the very fibers of Peter’s being. Therefore, when he spoke
concerning the Lord’s blood, he added the word “precious.” This adjective
touches our feeling. As he uttered this word, Peter must have had a certain
feeling within him regarding the preciousness of the blood of Christ. In 1:18
and 19 he says, “Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things,
with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your
fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot, the blood of Christ.” Do you not believe that Peter expressed a
particular feeling when he uttered these words? In verse 23 of the same chapter
Peter goes on to say, “Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.” In this verse Peter
speaks of the incorruptible seed and of the living and abiding word. In 1:4 he
describes our inheritance as “incorruptible and undefiled and unfading.” Thus,
in these verses, as illustrations of Peter’s practice of using adjectives, we
have the words precious, incorruptible, living, abiding, undefiled, and
unfading. This indicates that in this particular characteristic Peter is
stronger, higher, and richer than Paul. </span></p>

color:black'>First Peter 2:21 says that Christ suffered on our behalf, leaving
us a model that we should follow in His steps. The Greek word rendered “model”
is difficult to translate. Some versions use the word “example.” Literally, the
Greek word means a writing copy. Thus, the Lord Jesus is our writing copy, an
under-writing used by students to trace letters in learning to draw them. A
modern term to describe the process of copying is “xeroxing.” Xeroxing does not
involve following or imitating. On the contrary, xeroxing is a matter of
reproducing an original. Christ is a writing copy not for us to imitate nor
merely to follow. Rather, He is a writing copy to be xeroxed into us. This
means that we all should become reproductions, xerox copies, of Christ. This is
the significance of the Greek word translated “model” in 2:21, a term not used
by Paul in his writings.</span></p>

color:black'>In 3:7 Peter uses another unique expression—“grace of life.” We
are familiar with the words grace and life, but not with the expression “grace
of life.” As weaker vessels, the wives are joint-heirs with their husbands of
the grace of life. What a sweet expression! We, however, may be familiar with
the grace of salvation or the grace of forgiveness without ever having been
impressed with the grace of life. In his writings, Paul does not use this
particular precious and sweet expression.</span></p>

from the house of God.” Here we have a particular expression on the negative
side: God’s judgment beginning from His own household. Paul does not tell us
this. But Peter is very particular in the matter of God’s judgment beginning
from His own household.</span></p>

color:black'>Paul often uses the expression “grace to you and peace.” Peter,
however, twice speaks of grace and peace being multiplied. In 1:2 he says,
“Grace to you and peace be multiplied,” and in 2 Peter 1:2, “Grace to you and
peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.” Peter
desires not only that grace be with the saints, but that grace be multiplied to
them. Have you ever thought about what it means for grace to be multiplied? Have
you ever heard of a sermon or message telling you that grace and peace can be
multiplied? Most of us may find this expression puzzling. Peter’s use of the
word “multiplied” is another illustration of his particularity. In this matter,
not even Paul was as particular as Peter, for he never spoke in his Epistles of
grace and peace being multiplied.</span></p>

color:black'>The word multiplied indicates that a certain thing is present and
that instead of having another of the same thing added, we need what we have to
be multiplied. This means that we need the multiplication of the grace we
already have. We do not need another grace. What we need is to have multiplied
the grace we have already.</span></p>

color:black'>With the thought of multiplied grace as the base, Peter goes on to
speak in 4:10 of varied grace: “Each one according as he has received a gift,
ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.”
We all should be good stewards of what Peter calls varied grace, grace in
different aspects and of different categories. Peter mentions grace again in
5:10, where he speaks of the God of all grace. Therefore, in 1 Peter we have
four unique expressions concerning grace: grace of life, multiplied grace,
varied grace, and all grace. The grace of life is being multiplied in us. Then
it becomes the varied grace and eventually, the all grace. As a result, we do
not have grace just from one direction, but from many directions, for example,
from the heavens and from the earth, from our husband or wife, and from our
children. The more children we have, the more aspects of grace we shall
experience. If you have four children, you will enjoy grace in four aspects.
But if you have more children, you will enjoy more aspects of grace. In like
manner, if a brother is unmarried, he will lack a particular aspect of grace. A
married brother will experience grace in a particular aspect. </span></p>

color:black'>In 2 Peter 1:3 Peter says, “As His divine power has granted to us
all things which relate to life and godliness.” It seems that Peter likes to
use the word “all.” In 5:10 he speaks of all grace; here in 2 Peter 1:3, of all
things. The words “all things which relate to life and godliness” are a
tremendous expression. We cannot find such an expression in the Epistles of
Paul. Peter is the one who tells us that the divine power has granted us all
things related to life and godliness, that is, all things pertaining to life
inwardly and to godliness, the expression of God, outwardly.</span></p>

precious and exceedingly great promises, that through these you might become
partakers of the divine nature.” The Greek word “exceedingly great” is
difficult to translate. If it is rendered literally, it should be translated as
“greatest.” God has given us promises that are not only precious, but promises
that are exceedingly great.</span></p>

exceedingly great promises so that through them we may become partakers of the
divine nature. We are partakers of the divine nature. How marvelous that we can
be partakers of the divine nature! Do you realize that you are a partaker of
the divine nature, a partaker of the nature of God? We human beings can
actually become partakers of the divine nature. This means that, as believers
in Christ, we have not only the divine life, but we are now partaking,
enjoying, participating in, the divine nature. If Paul were to read such an
expression, he would have to say, “Brother Peter, in this matter, your writing
surpasses mine.”</span></p>

heavens and new earth. This is mentioned in the writings of Peter and of John,
who was intimately related to Peter. (Often in the book of Acts the names of
Peter and John are put together.) In the book of Revelation John gives a long
record of the new heavens and the new earth. Peter, however, utters only a
short word in 2 Peter 3:13: “But according to His promise we are expecting new
heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.” Peter’s word
concerning the new heavens and the new earth is yet another illustration of how
his writings contain particulars not found in the writings of Paul.</span></p>

Nevertheless, the span of Peter’s writings is vast. For example, in 1:2 he
speaks of the foreknowledge of God the Father. Then in 1:20 he says that Christ
was foreknown before the foundation of the world. Based upon His foreknowledge.
God chose us. As we shall see, we were chosen before the foundation of the
world. Peter’s mentioning of the foreknowledge of God and of Christ being
foreknown before the foundation of the world indicates that the span of his
writing begins from eternity past, from before the foundation of the world.
Then, as we have indicated, Peter has a word concerning the new heavens and the
new earth. This refers to eternity in the future, for it will be in eternity
future that there will be the new heavens and new earth. By this we can see
that the span of Peter’s writings embraces the two eternities; it goes from
eternity past to eternity future.</span></p>

color:black'>What about the scope of Peter’s Epistles? The scope also is very
broad. The scope of Peter’s ministry is wide. This is indicated by the first
two verses of 1 Peter, chapter one: “Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the
chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification
of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.” How
broad is the scope and how rich is the content of these verses! Here we have
the Father’s selection, the Spirit’s sanctification, and the Son’s redemption.
Of course, in verse 2 Peter does not use the word redemption. He purposely uses
another expression—the “sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.” It would have
been too simple merely to use the word redemption. But to speak of the
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is to expound the matter of redemption,
define it, and apply it. The sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is the
application of redemption. It is redemption expounded, defined, and applied.</span></p>

Trinity of the Godhead operating on the elect for their participation in the

for their participation in His full salvation. We shall cover this definition
more fully a little later. At this point, we refer to it to indicate how broad

As we know, Matthew is on the kingdom. Do not think that the government and the
kingdom are identical. No, the kingdom is one thing and the government is
another. A country or nation has a government. The government, however, is not
the nation; rather, the government is the administrative center of the nation.
For example, the government in Washington, D.C., is the administrative center
of the United States. Although Matthew presents the kingdom, the government is
not found in that book. The government of God is in the writings of Peter.</span></p>

children of Israel experienced God’s judgment again and again. With the
exception of Joshua and Caleb, all those who came out of Egypt, including Moses,

color:black'>The reason the two Epistles of Peter were written, especially the
first, was that the dispersed Jewish believers were suffering persecution. They
were undergoing a fiery trial. Peter compares this persecution to the burning
of a furnace. Because the believers were troubled and perhaps doubting, Peter
wrote to instruct them and also to comfort them. In 5:10 he says, “But the God
of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ, after you have
suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and
ground you.” Here Peter seems to be telling the believers that there is no need
for them to doubt, for God is perfecting them. Just as stones are cut in order
to be fit together in a building, we also need to be “cut” in order to be
perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded. Peter wrote to comfort the
suffering, persecuted saints, showing them that all of them were under God’s
government. The exercise of God’s government is first upon His own children.</span></p>

government of God. The subject of 2 Peter is a little different: it is the
divine provision and the divine government. In his second Epistle Peter shows
us that God is not only governing us, ruling us, but also providing us with
whatever we need. God supplies us all things to live a holy life, a Christian
life, under His government.</span></p>

color:black'>The word “chosen” brings in the thought of God’s government. Both
of Peter’s Epistles (2 Pet. 3:1) are concerned with the government of God.
God’s government is universal; it deals with all His creatures in order that He
may have a clean and pure universe (2 Pet. 3:13) to express Himself. In the New
Testament age, this dealing begins from His chosen people, His elect, His own
household (1 Pet. 4:17), especially from His chosen pilgrims who are dispersed
and sojourning among the nations, the Gentiles, as His testimony. Hence, these
two books emphasize the believers’ being chosen (2:9; 5:13; 2 Pet. 1:10). As
God’s chosen race, God’s choice, God’s particular possession, the dispersed chosen
pilgrims need to see that they are under God’s governmental dealing for a
positive purpose, regardless of the situation and environment they are in.
Anything and everything that happens to them, whether persecution or any other
kind of trial and suffering (1 Pet. 1:6; 5:9), is just a part of God’s precious
governmental dealing. Such a vision will perfect, establish, strengthen, and
ground them (5:10) that they may grow in grace (2 Pet. 3:18).</span></p>

color:black'>The Greek word rendered pilgrims can also be translated sojourners.
Strictly speaking, this term in this book refers to the Jewish believers who
were sojourners, foreigners, dispersed in the Gentile world (2:11-12). However,
the principle of pilgrims can be applied to all believers, both Jewish and
Gentile, because all are the heavenly pilgrims sojourning as foreigners on this
earth. These pilgrims are God’s elect, chosen by God out of the human race, out
of all the nations (Rev. 5:9-10), according to His foreknowledge (1 Pet. 1:2).</span></p>

Father’s choosing, His selection, is the initiation; God the Spirit’s
sanctification carries out the selection of God the Father; and God the Son’s
redemption, signified by the sprinkling of His blood, is the completion.
Through these steps the believers have been chosen, sanctified, and redeemed
into the enjoyment of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—into
whom they have been baptized (Matt. 28:19) and whose virtues they are enjoying
(2 Cor. 13:14).</span></p>

the main emphasis of this chapter, an emphasis on holiness (vv. 15-16), is
before the obedience of faith in Christ’s redemption, that is, before
justification through Christ’s redemption (1 Cor. 6:11), indicating that the
believers’ obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit’s sanctifying
work. The Spirit’s sanctification in its two aspects is inclusively revealed in
2 Thessalonians 2:13, which is for the full salvation of God to His chosen
people. God’s full salvation is carried out in the sphere of the Spirit’s
sanctification.</span></p>

for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.” On
the one hand, we have been saved; on the other hand, we still need to grow unto
salvation. This means that there is a further salvation that we have not yet reached.
In other words we are short of some kind of salvation. We do not yet have it,
and we need to grow unto it. We need to keep on growing until we reach, arrive
at, full salvation. According to 1:5, this is the salvation that is “ready to

that the Lord will save them from their temper. They may say, “O Lord, save me
from my temper. I don’t want to lose my temper anymore. Lord, You are Immanuel,
God with us. You are also Jesus, the One who delivers His people from their

have a good married life and a happy family life. Yes, this is true, and it is
part of our testimony. There are times when the husband, the wife, and the
children will happily praise the Lord. But we must also admit that sometimes
our family life is not at all like this, for a brother and his wife may argue,
and the children may be very unhappy. This indicates that we need the Savior

aspects. We need to know both aspects and what they accomplish. The first
aspect of sanctification precedes justification, and it carries out God’s
choice, His selection, and brings the chosen ones to the obedience and
sprinkling of the blood for their justification. Thus, this aspect of the
Spirit’s sanctification is before justification through the redemption of
Christ. Then, following justification, the Spirit continues to work to sanctify
us dispositionally. The sequence is this: God’s selection, the Spirit’s sanctification,
justification, and then subjective sanctification. Not many Christians have
seen this. Many Christian teachers say that God’s selection comes first, then
justification, and then the Spirit’s sanctification. However, this does not
take into account the two aspects of the sanctification of the Spirit, for it
refers only to the second aspect, subjective or dispositional sanctification.
We have pointed out that subjective sanctification of the Spirit is revealed in
Romans 6 and 15. But before we can have subjective sanctification of the
Spirit, we must have the first aspect of the Spirit’s sanctification, the
sanctifying work that takes place before God’s justification.</span></p>

redemption. He came to separate us for the obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Christ. When we obey, the blood sprinkles us. It is the sanctifying
Spirit who separates us from the world unto the obedience of Christ’s blood.
First we repent and believe, and then we obey what Christ has done on the
cross. Following this, we receive the sprinkling of the blood of Christ. This
is the sanctifying work of the Spirit following God’s selection to carry out
God’s choice and to bring us to Christ’s redemption.</span></p>

the first aspect; in Romans 6:19 and 22, the second; and in 2 Thessalonians

having no direction, but the Spirit carried out God’s selection of us. As a
result, we repented, believed, and received the sprinkling of the blood shed by
Christ on the cross. Therefore, we have the move of the Father, the Spirit, and
the Son. This is the operation of the Trinity of the Godhead upon His chosen
people, His elect, so that they may participate in His full salvation. This is
one way of speaking concerning what is revealed in 1:1 and 2.</span></p>
